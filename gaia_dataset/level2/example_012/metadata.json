    "Steps": "1. Opened the PNG file.\n2. Made separate lists of the red numbers and green numbers.\n3. Opened a Python compiler.\n4. Ran the following code:\n```\nimport statistics as st\nred = st.pstdev([24, 74, 28, 54, 73, 33, 64, 73, 60, 53, 59, 40, 65, 76, 48, 34, 62, 70, 31, 24, 51, 55, 78, 76, 41, 77, 51])\ngreen = st.stdev([39, 29, 28, 72, 68, 47, 64, 74, 72, 40, 75, 26, 27, 37, 31, 55, 44, 64, 65, 38, 46, 66, 35, 76, 61, 53, 49])\navg = st.mean([red, green])\nprint(avg)\n```\n5. Rounded the output.",
