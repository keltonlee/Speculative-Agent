  "question": "This spreadsheet contains a list of clients for a retractable awning company. Each client has ordered a new awning for the back of their house within the last 90 days. The company makes different designs depending on whether the awning is made to block sunrises or sunsets. In this region, houses with odd-numbered street addresses face east, and houses with even-numbered street addresses face west. How many of these clients will be receiving the sunset awning design?",

    "Steps": "1. Open the attached spreadsheet.\n2. Count the number of even and odd street addresses: 4 are even and 8 are odd. So, 4 houses face west and 8 houses face east.\n3. Since these awnings are for the backyard, the houses that face east have a back facing west, and vice-versa. Since the sun sets in the west, the 8 east-facing houses need the sunset-style awning.",
