  "question": "I\u2019m researching species that became invasive after people who kept them as pets released them. There\u2019s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020?
