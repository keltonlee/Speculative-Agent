    "Steps": "1. Searched \"ScienceDirect\" on Google.\n2. Opened the ScienceDirect website.\n3. Clicked on the top listed domain in the Life Science section on the main page (Agricultural and Biological Sciences).\n4. Clicked on \"Reference works\" in the filters.\n5. Noted the number at the top.\n6. Subtracted the number that had 2023 or later as a date.\n7. Changed the domain to the following one and noted the number.\n8. Repeated step 6 for all Life Science domains.\n9. Calculated the sample standard deviation (16.195678435929).\n10. Went back to the home page.\n11. Repeated steps 3-9 for Health Science (15.926916420534).\n12. Subtracted 16.195678435929 - 15.926916420534.\n13. Rounded to the third decimal place.",
