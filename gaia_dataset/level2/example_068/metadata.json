    "Steps": "1. Go to the Wikipedia page for \"United States secretary of homeland security\".\n2. Open the Wikipedia pages for each person who held the position of United States secretary of homeland security in a non-acting capacity prior to April 2019.\n3. Using the infobox on each person's Wikipedia page, open the Wikipedia page for the university from which each person received a bachelor's degree (bachelor's degree indicated by AB, BA, or BS).\n4. Comparing the longitude coordinates for each university given on their Wikipedia pages, note that Santa Clara University is the westernmost as it has the highest longitude value in degrees W.\n5. Note that the easternmost is either Harvard University or University of Massachusetts Boston, but the longitude for Harvard University is expressed in degrees, minutes, and seconds (71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W) while the longitude for University of Massachusetts Boston is expressed in decimal degrees (71.038445\u00b0W), requiring conversion to determine which is further east.\n6. Convert 71\u00b007\u203201\u2033W to decimal degrees using the formula [decimal degrees] = [degrees] + [minutes] / 60 + [seconds] / 3600 to get approximately 71.1169\u00b0W for Harvard's longitude, which is further west than the University of Massachusetts Boston's longitude.\n7. Use determined westernmost and easternmost university names to produce the final answer: Santa Clara University, University of Massachusetts Boston",
