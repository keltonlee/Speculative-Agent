    "Steps": "1. Google \"American Survivor Winners\". Scroll down to the Wikipedia listing \"Survivor (American TV Series)\".\n    Search, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series),  \n2.I begin to make a list of all the Survivor winners and their seasons. \n3.I google \"survivor cast CBS\" and click on cast tab at cbs.com (https://www.cbs.com/shows/survivor/cast/). It features the players of the most recently aired season. I click on the Seasons tab and scroll down to the first season. I find the winner from the first season (based on my list compiled from the en.wikipedia.org site mentioned in step 1) and scroll through the bio information until I see the mention of their birthday. It is usually contained in the last sentence of the bio. I repeat this process until I get to Season 18. It is at this point that CBS starts to omit the full birthdays. For seasons 18 and 19 they include the month and date but omit the year. By Season 20, the birthday is omitted completely. \n4. So now I am making a simple template entry in google for each successive winner: When was (insert winner's name), winner of (insert season they won) of Survivor born?  There are usually two prominent sites I look for in my Google feed for this information:\n\n             1. Wikipedia page for that contestant: ex.: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._T._Thomas_(Survivor_contestant)\n             2. Survivor Wiki: ex.: https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/J.T._Thomas   \n                Overall I have found the fan pages to be pretty reliable. If both options were available, I did take the opportunity to verify \n                that they matched up. I did not find any discrepancies (as far as birthdays) between the two.\n\n5. Now I have a list of all forty of the winners from the first forty seasons of Survivor (two of them have won twice). I comb the list and \nnote the months when they are mentioned and how many times that they appear. Michele Fitzgerald, the winner of Season 32 of Survivor, is the only listed with a birthday in May.",
    "Number of steps": "I have five main processes listed but the individual steps for each winner (and any confirmation searches) would place it into the 40-60 range.",
