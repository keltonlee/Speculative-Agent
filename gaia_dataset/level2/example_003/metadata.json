    "Steps": "1. Searched \"Unlambda syntax\" online (optional).\n2. Opened https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unlambda.\n3. Note that the hello world program is very similar in syntax to the code in this question.\n4. Go to the source referenced by the hello world program.\n5. From the referenced source, read what the components of the program do to understand that each period needs a backtick after the initial `r.\n6. Observe that in the given code, there are 12 periods but only 11 backticks after the initial `r, so the missing character is a backtick.",
