    "Steps": "1. Search the web for \u201cAntidisestablishmentarianism\u201d.\n2. Click the Wikipedia result.\n3. Click \u201cView history\u201d to see edits made to the page.\n4. Click \u201c500\u201d to view 500 edits on the page at a time.\n5. Note that no edits appear to have been made after May of 2023, so all 500 edits on the current page meet the question\u2019s criteria.\n6. Click \u201colder 500\u201d to view older edits.\n7. Repeat until I reach the end of the revisions, counting how many sets of 500 I passed until reaching the last page.\n8. On the last page, Ctrl-F for \u201ccur\u201d and \u201cprev\u201d. These abbreviations appear before every revision, so the number of times they each appear on the page (minus the number of times they each appear in the description at the top) is the number of revisions on this page.\n9. Add the number of revisions on the last page (232), to the number from the pages of 500 (5 pages times 500 edits equals 2500) to get the answer, 2732.",
