    "Steps": "1. Searched \"volume from pressure, temperature, mass\" on Google.\n2. Opened the \"Specific Volume: Definition, Formulas, Examples - ThoughtCo\" page.\n3. Noted that PV = nRT where V is volume, R is the ideal gas constant, T is temperature, P is pressure, and M is moles.\n4. Followed the \"gas constant\" link.\n5. Noted that R = 8.31446261815324 J/K-mol.\n6. Searched \"Freon-12\" on Google.\n7. Opened the \"Dichlorodifluoromethane\" on Wikipedia.\n8. Noted the molar mass of 120.91 g/mol.\n9. Converted 0.312 kg = 312 g.\n10. Calculated moles: 312 g / 120.91 g/mol = 2.58 mol.\n11. Searched \"Marianas Trench pressure\" on Google.\n12. Noted the pressure in the featured text snippet of 15,750 psi.\n13. Searched \"psi to atm\" on Google.\n14. Noted 1 psi = 0.068046 atm.\n15. Converted psi to atm: 15,750 * 0.068046 = 1071.7245 atm.\n16. Searched \"Marianas Trench temperature\" on Google.\n17. Noted the temperature range from 34-39F.\n18. Searched \"F to K\" on Google.\n19. Noted that K equals F plus 459.67 times 5/9 from the conversion tool.\n20. Converted temperature to K: 39 + 459.67 * 5/9 = 277.039K.\n21. Searched \"joules to atm\" on Google and noted the conversion of 1 Joule = 0.0098692326671601 Liter Atmosphere from the featured text snippet.\n22. Converted 8.31446261815324 * 0.0098692326671601 = 0.08205736608096 L-atm/K-mol.\n21. Changed PV = nRT to V = nRT/P\n22. Plugged numbers into the ideal gas equation: V = (0.08205736608096 L-atm/K-mol * 277.039K * 2.58 mol) / (1071.7245 atm) = 0.05473 L.\n23. Converted to mL: 0.05473 L = 54.73.\n24. Rounded to the nearest mL.",
