    "Steps": "1. Searched \"NIH translation 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper\" on Google.\n2. Opened \"The Original Michaelis Constant: Translation of the 1913 Michaelis-Menten Paper\" on the NIH website.\n3. Scrolled down to the final equation: v = (km \u22c5 [S]) / (1 + (km/kcat) \u22c5 [S]).\n4. Opened the Excel file.\n5. Searched \"Michaelis-Menten equation\" on Google to find the meaning of the variables.\n6. Opened the Wikipedia \"Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics\" page.\n7. Noted v = reaction rate (velocity of reaction) and kcat = catalytic rate constant (catalytic constant).\n8. Returned to the NIH paper and found km = Menten constant and [S] = substrate concentration.\n9. Plugged reaction 7's values from the Excel file into the equation: v = (0.052 * 72.3) / (1 + (0.052 / 0.0429) * 72.3) = 0.042416.\n10. Rounded to four decimal places (0.0424).",
