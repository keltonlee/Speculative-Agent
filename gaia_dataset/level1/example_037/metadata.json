    "Steps": "1. I start with the first line, \"T H E S E\" and proceed to the next, \"A G U L L\". At this point, I am able to discern that \"A G U L L\" is probably meant to be \"A GULL\". However, I continue to read through the rest of the lines to get a sense of any other words that might jump out that would substantiate \"A GULL\" being accurate both semantically and syntactically. 2. So now I am on the last line and decide to work backwards. \"CHAIR\" is on the last line all by itself and this does seem a plausible fit as a full word rather than a fragment of another word. When I look to the line directly above \"Y T O M Y\", the word \"my\" jumps out and this is a natural accompaniment to the noun often used to indicate possession. \n3. Eliminating the \"MY\" at the end of \"Y T O MY\" leaves \"Y T O\" remaining in the line and I immediately recognize the preposition \"TO\". It is a this point I am fairly confident that \"TO MY CHAIR\" is most likely accurate. Given that there is only a \"Y\" left, I discern it is more than likely the end of a word located in the row above.\n4. I am now on the fifth row down and am looking at the letters \"E F U L L\" Attaching the \"Y\" left over from the sixth row below I see \"E F U L L Y\"  I recognize the word \"FULLY\" I know it can stand alone as an adverb or it can serve as a suffix to a larger adverb.\n5. Detaching the \"FULLY\", leaves the \"E\" alone on the line. Knowing it does not represent a word on its own in the English language, I look to attach it to the line above (row 4).\n6. The fourth row reads \"D P E A C\". Adding the \"E\" to the end, the first word I can separate out is \"ACE\". However \"ACEFULLY\" is not a word nor does \"ACE FULLY TO MY CHAIR\" make sense. When working my way left through the line, continuing to attach each letter as I go, I land on the \"P\" and am fairly confident that the word is \"PEACEFULLY\".\n7. Eliminating the \"PEAC\" from the row leaves me left with a \"D\". Now I look at the row above, row 3 and see that the row comprises the word \"GLIDE\" Adding the \"D\" to the end of the word would not only be permissible in terms of a displaying appropriate tense but it also makes sense as I add it to the fragment I have so far. I now can read \"GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".\n8. Now, I am on the second line and if I were to read it from there on down it would read \"A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR\".  While this reads well and makes sense semantically and syntactically on its own, it does not make sense when I add the first row. THESE A GULL GLIDED PEACEFULLY TO MY CHAIR.  So now I am left with the conclusion that  \"A GULL\" is not correct. Either it is part of a larger word or the letters need to be broken down further. At a quick glace, I can see that they don't make sense being broken down further so I leave \"GULL\" and add the \"A\" to the string above. Immediately my eye sees that \"A can be added to \"SE\" to make \"SEA\" and that the remaining\nletters spell the word \"THE\"  I now know the sentence reads \"The seagull glided peacefully to my chair.",
