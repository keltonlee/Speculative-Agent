    "Steps": "1. Determine the truth values of the first statement: Recognize this is one of De Morgan's Laws showing how to distribute negation over the and conjunction - so it is a tautology.\n2. Determine the truth values of the second statement: Recognize this is one of De Morgan's Laws showing how to distribute negation over the or - so it is a tautology.\n3. Determine the truth values of the third statement: Recognize this is the definition of the contrapositive - so it is a tautology.\n4. Determine the truth values of the fourth statement: Recognize this as an alternative way of stating the conditional - so it is a tautology.\n5. Determine the truth values of the fifth statement: I don't recognize this, so check its truth values:\n6. A: True, B: True |  (\u00acA \u2192 B) \u2194 (A \u2228 \u00acB) = (\u00acT \u2192 T) \u2194 (T \u2228 \u00acT) = (F \u2192 T) \u2194 (T \u2228 F) = T \u2194 T = T\n7.

The fifth statement is not a tautology so is the statement that is not logically equivalent. We were asked for only one statement, so can stop here.",
