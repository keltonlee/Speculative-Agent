  "question": "You are a telecommunications engineer who wants to build cell phone towers on a stretch of road. In the reference file is a layout of the road and nearby houses. Each dash, \"-\", is a marker indicating a mile. Each capital H indicates a house located next to a mile marker, appearing above or below the stretch of road. Each cell phone tower can cover houses located next to the road within a 4-mile radius. Find the minimum number of cell phone towers needed to cover all houses next to the road. Your answer should be a positive numerical integer value.",

    "Steps": "1. Determine the diameter of each cell phone tower's coverage: 2 x 4 miles radius = 8 miles diameter.\n2. Use the diameter to maximize the coverage of each tower by capturing houses 4 miles to the left and 4 miles to the right.\n3. Start from the furthest left side of the road at the first house.\n4. Place the first tower 4 miles in to cover the first house.\n5. Move forward 4 miles from the first tower. The first tower also covers the house above mile marker 8. \n6. Find the next uncovered house below mile marker 12.\n7. Move 4 miles in from the uncovered house and place a second tower. The house is now covered. \n8. Move forward 4 miles from the second tower. The second tower also covers the house above mile marker 16.\n9. Find the next uncovered house below mile marker 25.\n10. Move 4 miles in from the uncovered house and place a third tower. The third tower also covers the house above marker 28.\n11. Move forward 4 miles from the third tower. The third tower also covers the last house below marker 30.\n12. The final number of cell phone towers erected is 3.\n\n",
